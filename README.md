this is a program built by using pyqt6 as i wan not able to use pyside6 due to an error that i could not solve. The program is meant to be a prisoner housing allocation system where a prisoner
gets matched to a correct certain RHU. some of the program works as of now but is not fully completed, i would say 50%/60% is completed and is fully functional.
